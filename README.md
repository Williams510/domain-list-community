About me
I grew up in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and started Elite gymnastics at an age of 18 🤸🏻‍♂️ It’s pretty late to start with gymnastics at an age like that. I learned that if you have a passion for something, work hard & persist, **you can achieve anything you want** 🚀



After graduating as a PE (Physical Education) teacher I started my Sports Businesses where I create (online) sport programs to educate coaches and people who want to achieve their goals in sports. I started my business from scratch (with no experience). While I was building my company I also transformed myself into an online marketeer. I have spent countless hours on marketing courses, listening to podcasts, and reading articles. Marketing is one of the favorite parts of having a business 👨‍💻



Besides my business, I always had a passion for creating passive income. Doing the things I like without worrying about getting an income is one of the best feelings in the world.
